## AI chat plugin for Obsidian

Chat to AI about your documents/notes.

**Supported APIs**: OpenRouter, OpenAI and OpenAI compatible

**Features**: Multiple documents, Image support, Markdown support, API profiles.

**Disclaimer**: API keys are not provided, bring your own. This plugin will connect to the API provider/endpoint you specify, your chat messages and the content of your choosen documents/notes will be shared with this provider/endpoint.

**Info**: To work with multiple documents use the pinning feature: hover over the document name at the top of the chat and press the pin button to lock it. Pin as many documents as you need. The hide button is in the same place. If you cant find the chat, use the `AI Chat: Show chat` command.

**Update**: 1.0.4 has major changes to the internals in order to support images, model fetching, etc. Bespoke support for certain providers was dropped. Using OpenRouter is recommended instead.
